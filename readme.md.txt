# JavaScript Basics - Part 1: Variables

This repository covers the basics of **variables** in JavaScript. In this section, we will explore the different types of variables, their characteristics, and when to use each type.

## Overview of Variables in JavaScript

In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. There are three main ways to declare variables:

### 1. `const` (Constant)

```javascript
// The const keyword is used to declare variables whose values cannot be reassigned after initialization.
const PI = 3.14;  // The value of PI will never change
```

- **Definition**: The `const` keyword is used to declare variables whose values cannot be reassigned after initialization.
- **Scope**: Block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block (e.g., a loop, function, or if statement) where they are defined.
- **When to Use**: Use `const` for values that should remain constant throughout the program, such as configuration settings or fixed values.

### 2. `let` (Variable)

```javascript
// The let keyword is used to declare variables that can have their values reassigned.
let counter = 0;  // Counter can change during the execution of the loop
```

- **Definition**: The `let` keyword is used to declare variables that can have their values reassigned.
- **Scope**: Block-scoped, similar to `const`.
- **When to Use**: Use `let` when the value of the variable might change during the program's execution, such as in loops or when handling user input.

### 3. `var` (Old way of declaring variables)

```javascript
// The var keyword is used to declare variables, but it is function-scoped (not block-scoped like let and const).
function example() {
    var message = "Hello World";  // Function-scoped variable
}
```

- **Definition**: The `var` keyword is used to declare variables, but it is function-scoped (not block-scoped like `let` and `const`).
- **Scope**: Function-scoped, meaning that if a variable is declared inside a function, it is accessible anywhere within that function.
- **When to Use**: Avoid using `var` in modern JavaScript unless you need to support older environments. `let` and `const` are recommended for clearer scoping and fewer errors.

## Key Differences Between `const`, `let`, and `var`

- **Reassignment**: 
  - `const` cannot be reassigned after its initial value is set.
  - `let` can be reassigned.
  - `var` can be reassigned, but its behavior is less predictable due to function-scoping.

- **Scope**: 
  - `const` and `let` are block-scoped, which means they are confined to the block (e.g., inside `{ }`).
  - `var` is function-scoped, meaning it is confined to the function it is declared in, but it is not limited to blocks (like loops or conditionals).

- **Hoisting**: 
  - `var` is hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized with `undefined`.
  - `let` and `const` are hoisted as well but are in a "temporal dead zone" until they are declared.

## Best Practices

- **Prefer `const` over `let`**: Always use `const` unless you know the variable needs to be reassigned. This improves code readability and helps avoid accidental changes to values.
- **Avoid `var`**: In modern JavaScript, avoid using `var` as it has confusing scoping rules. Stick with `let` and `const`.
- **Use meaningful names**: Choose variable names that describe the purpose of the data they store. For example, `userAge` is better than `x`.
